# SAM2 for Surgical Workflow Analysis

## Project Overview
"We are trying to get SAM2 to help with the 'Surgical Workflow Analysis' problem."

## Implementation Details
- **Video Processing**: In the `SAM_Video.ipynb` notebook, we employed YOLO for detecting polyps in the first frame. The bounding boxes generated by YOLO serve as prompts for SAM2 to analyze the workflow effectively.
  
- **Frame Extraction**: Within the same notebook, there is a section labeled **"# convert Video to Frame"** where we modified the extraction rate to obtain **5 frames per second** instead of the default **25 frames**.

## Model Weights
We have fine-tuned the weights of YOLOv8 on the colonoscopy dataset. You can download the weights from the following link:
