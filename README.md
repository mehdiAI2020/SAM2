SAM2 for Surgical Workflow Analysis
Project Overview
We are utilizing SAM2 to assist with the Surgical Workflow Analysis problem. The objective is to enhance the efficiency of surgical procedures by analyzing video frames and detecting critical elements.

Implementation Details
Video Processing: In the SAM_Video.ipynb notebook, we employed YOLO for detecting polyps in the first frame. The bounding boxes generated by YOLO serve as prompts for SAM2 to analyze the workflow effectively.

Frame Extraction: Within the same notebook, there is a section labeled "# convert Video to Frame" where we modified the extraction rate to obtain 5 frames per second instead of the default 25 frames.

Model Weights
We have fine-tuned the weights of YOLOv8 on the colonoscopy dataset. You can download the weights from the following link:
